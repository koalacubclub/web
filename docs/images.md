# Images & assets

How raster images get into the client. The pipeline has a couple of non-obvious
edges — get these right and there's nothing to hand-maintain.

## The two paths

**1. Responsive photos → `client/src/assets/` + vite-imagetools.**
Any photo shown at real display sizes goes through [vite-imagetools][it], which
emits downscaled, content-hashed WebP variants at build. Don't ship a full-res
photo to a `<img>` or a canvas draw.

- Reference patterns: `src/data/reelPosters.ts` (the reel feed) and
  `src/data/heroPhoto.ts` (the Koala photo).
- Import with `import.meta.glob(path, { query, import: 'default', eager: true }) as Record<string, string>`.
  Use `?…&as=srcset` for a `srcSet` string, or no `as=` for a single URL.
- **Do not** use a static `import x from './f.webp?w=…'`. The `?query` suffix
  means the specifier no longer ends in `.webp`, so vite/client's `*.webp`
  ambient type doesn't match and **`tsc -b` fails** (`pnpm build` runs `tsc`
  first). The glob-with-cast form sidesteps this.
- Match sizes to actual need. A canvas thumbnail drawn at ~64 device px only
  needs a ~128w source; a lightbox needs full res. Over-sizing is the whole
  problem you're avoiding.

**2. Verbatim static files → `client/public/`.**
Files here are copied to the build root untouched — **imagetools never sees
`public/`**. Use it for things that shouldn't be optimized: pixel-art game
sprites drawn on the canvas (`public/game/…`), `favicon`, `manifest`, `sw.js`,
`robots.txt`.

## The edge case: an image needs BOTH

Some assets need a **stable, unhashed public URL** _and_ want imagetools
variants from the same source — e.g. a photo that is both an `og:image`
(referenced by absolute URL in `index.html`, so it can't be a hashed bundle
asset) and drawn in-app at small sizes. `public/` can't feed imagetools, and
`src/assets/` doesn't produce a stable URL — so the naive fix is to keep a copy
in each and hand-sync them. Don't.

**Use `client/src/assets/rooted/` instead.** The `rootedAssets()` plugin in
`vite.config.ts` serves every file there at `/<name>` in dev and emits it
verbatim to the build root, while imagetools can still import it for variants.
One source of truth, nothing to sync — just drop the file in.

Example: `src/assets/rooted/hero.webp` is the `og:image`/`twitter:image` target
and the lightbox's full-res master (served at `/hero.webp`), and is _also_ the
source `heroPhoto.ts` reads to generate the tiny polaroid + hover variants.

## Painting them progressively (LQIP / blur-up)

Swapping a small variant up to a large one naively flashes blank while the large
one downloads. [`ProgressiveImage`](../client/src/components/ProgressiveImage.tsx)
avoids that: it paints an **already-cached** low-res image instantly, then swaps
to the fully-decoded high-res one in place. It's a drop-in `<img>` replacement.

The catch — and the reason it ties back to the variant sizes above — is that
`lowSrc` must genuinely be cheap and already fetched, or you're just wrapping a
plain `<img>` with no win. That's why the photo hover preview uses the 128w
`heroCanvasSrc` (preloaded on mount) as `lowSrc`, swapping up to the 320/480/640
`heroHoverSrcSet`; and the lightbox uses the 640w `heroHoverSrc` (already fetched
by the hover) as `lowSrc`, swapping up to full-res `/hero.webp`. Lazy-loaded
images (the reel feed, avatars) have no earlier cached copy, so they'd need a
dedicated tiny LQIP variant before this helps. See the component's JSDoc for the
mechanism and reuse caveats.
